She'll be right. Next time I reckon make the strike 70 if the grain isnt frozen\n\nThe hops mostly stayed in the top, filtered by the top malt pipe filter. It worked well :+1:\nThe wort was really clear this time, I'm not sure why. The only variable that has changed really was that hops were added and that the mash started a bit warm.\n\nMashed for a bit longer than usual because of a debacle with packaging the old beer. Boil was straightforward.\n\nHops we\u2019re all added loose. High Krausen hops were added at yeast pitch loose in the fermenter.\n\n\n\nPitched at pretty much perfect temp. Expecting a good beer. Efficiency was better than normal. Maybe kegland has a better crush. \n\nIt\u2019s already bubbling an hour later. This yeast is insane.",

First attempt with mash hopping! I'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\nAlso trying some Mandarina Bravaria this time and Eclipse (HPA-016) which apparently have Mandarin\/Tangerine flavours which should complement the lemon\/orange flavours",
