            "session_notes": "Too much strike water, recirculation wasn't working properly. I didn't stir the grain, I probable should have.\n\nHeated strike water to 72 to compensate for grain temp. After adding grain temp was 68 so 71 might be better next time. No mash out, just a sparge (2l) with hot water from tap.\n\nI could taste the mash hops, it was very smooth and tasty but I reckon there is room for more. Maybe 1.5-2x will be better next time but I'll see after fermentation.\n\n13l left after boil which didn't leave enough to fill fermenter to top and leave 1l of trub in kettle. Need more overall water next time but less strike. Maybe 16l strike and 5l sparge or something like that?\n\nTerrible efficiency ~40% probably because recirc wasn't working and I didn't stir. I could even taste that the gravity wasn't very high.\n\nPitching - Didn't hydrate, just gently poured on top of wort after racking. Pitched at 23 degrees. Probably infected it because I used the packet to try and get yeast off the tilt hydrometer.\n\nFermentation died off at 1.013. Was a bit low ABV even for a mid strength so I added 5ml ultra ferm as a gamble to see what would happen. We shall see!",

It worked well :+1:\nThe wort was really clear this time, I'm not sure why. The only variable that has changed really was that hops were added and that the mash started a bit warm.\n\nMashed for a bit longer than usual because of a debacle with packaging the old beer. Boil was straightforward.\n\nHops we\u2019re all added loose. High Krausen hops were added at yeast pitch loose in the fermenter.\n\n\n\nPitched at pretty much perfect temp. Expecting a good beer.

            "session_notes": "Turns out I have left over Mosiac so I'm subbing the cryo for double the amount of regular mosiac. Should update inventory and recipe to match\n\nNext time ignore quick water requirements and use the mash calculator (maybe) \nI did 16l strike 6.5l sparge @ 85 degrees\n\nI forgot that the recirc valve was half closed since the mashing so the recirc throughout the brewing was slow. The temp gauge was reading 24 so I started filling the fermenter. I gave the wort a bit of a stir and the temp went back to 30 so the wort in the fermenter is too hot to pitch. Will have to let it sit for a bit and then pitch.\n\nPitched at 26.6 degrees (as wort was cooling). Ferm chamber temp is still dropping toward 23\n\nNext morning (~12 h) and it seems to be bubbling more than the Kviek! The blow off cylinder overflowed everywhere and is yellow from overflowing wort. Next time should fill it up less high and maybe use a sanitizer without a surfactant. Smells good though. Krausen was really thick when I added the high Krausen hops, you could almost feel the gas blowing out of the fermenter.\n\nIt seems like the fermentation has finished according to the gravity but it is still bubbling away so I don\u2019t really know what the yeast is doing.\n\nI'm paranoid about oxidation for this brew because I wan't to to survive a trip to Melbourne so I added the dry hops while it still seemed to be fermenting on day 4. It was still bubbling every 5 seconds or so event though the Gravity seems stuck. At the same time, I removed the blow off valve and cleaned all the hop gunk out of it and replaced the blow off water with a fresh growler of sanitiser. Since fermentation is still going on this should be pretty safe RE oxidation. When cold crashing the growler should be wide enough that only sanitizer will get sucked up and no air will get in. A little bit of sanitizer getting in is probably better than air. I'll put a mark on the neck to measure exactly how much sanitizer actually gets in.\n\nI calculated that there is enough space in the tube that sanitizer won't get in.\nThe ferment just wont stop! I'm worried its infected but people say its normal for WLP644 so \/shrug\n\nTemp drop around day 14 wasn't intentional, I cut the power to do some DIY stuff and forgot to turn the temp controller back on and let it sit at the temp it was at (25?)\n\nSince the gravity is getting so low I'm going to adjust the recipe to add some maltodextrin.\n\nThis yeast is crazy and it seems like fermentation has started up again because it can probably eat maltodextrin. I'm going to leave it alone now\n\nAfter cold crashing it looked like it has sucked up a lot of water. The water level was up to the top, I\u2019m not sure if that was because I added the maltodextrin or because of some weird side syphon effect. There\u2019s probably like 500ml sanatizer in the beer. \n\nI calculated the same SMB dosage as the upper range in https:\/\/brulosophy.com\/2020\/04\/06\/impact-higher-dosage-rates-of-sodium-metabisulfite-smb-have-on-beer-character-exbeeriment-results\/\n0.55g per gallon\n13l = 3.4gallon\n3.4*0.55=1.9\n\nDivided into two additions:\nWhen cold crash reached ~4 degrees:\n0.9g SMB + 10ml biofine clear\n\nPlugged the fermenter tap into a purged keg and used the pressure (~10psi) to bubble up through the beer to get rid of co2 and mix up the smb and finings. I could use the tap to control the rate it actually worked pretty well \n\nWhen kegging:\n1g SMB + 10ml biofine clear\n\n24 hours of 30psi for burst carb\n\nDuring clean up the yeast slurry smelt amazing, I wish more of it was in my beer.\n\nOpinions before carbing:\nNo off flavours, maybe the tiniest bit of funk from the yeast but in a fruity good way. Very tropical. Bitter as usual but not too bad. I think it is going to be even better once carbonated.\n\nAfter carbing:\nNot much different than before carbing. Very drinkable. I don't like the colour as much, maybe there is a bit of suspended yeast in there that still hasn't flocculated out.",

            "session_notes": "- Water requirements seem to be off. There was a lot of wasted wort (above the false bottom). Probably like 5l but the markings down go down that low\n- 2.75 DAP was added to boil 10m\n- 12:42 Started mash out with 1900w element\n- 12:52 Mash out temp reached. Raised malt pipe\n- Rinsed malt pipe with water (6.5l) raised to 70 degrees\n- Mashing worked really well. Nothing got stuck\n- Forgot to put the water chemistry ingredients and acid in until 10m into mashing. I put them into overflow pipe and turned up the flow rate to rinse\/recirc them so it was probably fine\n- I didn't re-hydrate the yeast. It says on the yeast website that studies show you can pitch into wort fine. Although I was more gentle than usual, sprinkling on the top after I had finished filling it up.\n- To use up old Centenial hops I had lying around I changed recipe to 40g cent, 20g am, 20g lemon for whirlpool\n- Something has gone weird with the hop schedule, there are two kinds of Amarillo. Need to fix that.\n- No mash out temp in recipe, need to fix that\n- Used pink rock salt for water chemistry - does this matter?\n- Wort was flowing really well and the hot rinse helped I think.\n- The Munich malt got it two a nice orange colour. Could have maybe used about 50g more but its pretty good!\n- No peels used yet\n- It was bubbling within 1-2 hours. At 8:30 it had a super thick Krausen so I dumped the high Krause hops in\n- When I put the hops in I have to stir them in because the krausen is so thick!\n\n- Krausen is still super thick but the gravity has stopped moving so decided to cold crash. To go easy on the fridge I left the fridge door open with a fan pointed at the fermenter to cool the fermenter down to garage temp. In the morning I\u2019ll close the door and switch the fridge on to finish the crash. Maybe the slow crash will help the yeast clean up after itself. I think it will need a long crash because there is a lot of hops and gunk\n- Cooled to garage temp overnight and Krausen completely dropped out\n\n- It flocculated really well. The beer was hazy (expected) but no hop particulate or yeast. Tastes a lot more bitter than I remember when I tasted after the first dry hop (high krausen). I'm thinking that I used too much hops (one dry hop is probably enough) and that using more hops than the saturation point just contributes to bitterness. I couldn't get a full keg because there was so much crud on the bottom but it was pretty good.\n \n- Next brew: adjust hop charge down to reach saturation point OR just don't do the second dry hop (only high Krausen). Maybe a smidge more lactose too.",

            "session_notes": "Way too much grain for the kettle.\nIt was a mess and I couldn't use recirc. I just used it like a big batch sparge and stirred it often.\n\nI've halved the amount of Columbus hops in the boil because the IBU was too high.\nRemember to adjust the inventory\n\nSparge is stuck trying to mash out. Next time use rice hulls or something.\n\nWhat a mess. The OG was nowhere near expected.\n\nThe temp of the chiller outlet was at a good pitching temp (20ish) and then for some reason shot up while I was filling the fermenter so it ended up hotter than I expected but probably still ok (24?)\n\nThe first batch of sugar was raw sugar (250g) that flowed through the funnel easily.\n\nThe second batch of sugar was brown which was not easy to pour and pretty old so I boiled in 750ml water. I was impatient so added it when it was still 50-60 degrees but after mixing with the fermenter it should be fine.\n\nAll the sugar should add 21.82 points which is almost 3%!? Adjusted OG should be 1.092 so the final ABV should be around 10%\n\nConsidering putting in maltodextrin if all the sugar dries it out too much but we will see if we need it\n\nJust took a sample at 75% attenuation and it was full of yeast and had a taste that reminded me of crappy homebrew from back in the day. Hopefully that taste is just yeast and the sugar hasn't ruined it.\n\nThe terrible flavour isn\u2019t going away. Still trying to work out what it is. It\u2019s harsh and reminds me of the failed brews I did years ago. Probably alcohols from high ferment temp but also could be astringency\n\nI'll rack to a keg with some of the yeast and put 40g of sugar and see what happens if it naturally conditions in the basement. I might have to dump it but who knows?\n\nI think the yeast was stressed by the large dumps of sugar and\/or I under pitched. Either that or the mashing was really bad.\n\nIt is a bit more drinkable after conditioning for about a month. Everytime I taste it I feel like its different. I think the yeast contributes a bad taste sometimes I taste some yeast that has sunk to the bottom. I still can't taste the oak really but maybe masked by the bad flavours. I think it did naturally carb in the keg, the head is very soft and creamy which is one thing it has going for it.",

It will probably all just drop out in the fermenter.\nI also couldn't find the eye dropper to measure out the lactic acid but that probably won't matter either. The mash PH was kind of on the high side but still probably within the usual bounds.\n\nThe hop spider was also out of action so all the hops went straight into the kettle. It should all drop out in the fermenter as long as I'm careful not to stir it all up when I transfer.\n\nI wanted to make a more traditional IPA style, rather than a juicy\/hazy style so this is the first time I've tried a high sulphur to chloride ratio. Will be interesting to see how it comes out.\n\nThe fermentation is very consistent. Fast but not overflowing out of the blow off like most of the beers I brew. I'm upping the temp towards the end of fermentation to try and speed it up. Hopefully its not to early to make off flavours\n\nIt is still very cloudly, the S-05 doesn't seem to be the best flocculator. Hopefully it will clear up in the keg\n\nWhen sampling and when really fresh there was a bad taste I couldn't put my finger on. Turned out to be suspended yeast. It did clear up in the keg. Once the yeast was gone after the first pour it tasted much better and was 80% clear. No off flavours but tastes pretty anaemic. Needs either some hop bitterness or malt backbone or something.",

Probably should add that to the brew steps\n- Next time maybe raise the temp higher so when the mash goes in it is at target. 2-3 degrees higher should do it\n- I tasted the water after adding salts and it actually tasted different\n- Took off lid and gave the grain a good stir when 20m left on mash.\n- Stirred again just before raising to 75\n- Used the hotter element to raise to mash out but could hear boiling and the rate the water trickling through the mash was pretty low so hopefully it doesn't scorch (it didn't)\n- Temp raised to 75 very quickly (few minutes) and the flow rate through the mash was noticeably better. Started timer for 10 minutes once it hit 75. I'm not 100% certain flow rate was better but it seemed to be. I used the low power element once it hit 75 but it couldn't sustain temps so I used the hotter one again\n- Raised rinse water to 75 rather than just using hot tap water\n-when rinsing malt and stirring it fell in and wort went everywhere! MAKE SURE TO USE WINCH IN FUTURE IN CASE\n- Decided to try and let the wort cool itself to whirlpool temp so the chiller has to do less work. Put a sanitized lid on and put the pump on to try and encourage some cooling. Used the chiller between 88-82 degrees because impatient\n\n- Wort was ~19 so I switched off the chiller and it ended up about 21 in the fermenter\n-  Filled fermenter right to 13l - water calcs seem spot on!\n- Yeast rehydration was a bit rushed - it was mostly ok, but the rest after the stir wasn't very long so it might not have had much time to cool down to wort temp. I tried to splash wort into the yeast cup over time to try and change temp slower, it takes a while to transfer to fermenter\n\n- Was already bubbling away next morning so the yeast must be happy\n- Yeast very happy monday\n\nTasting before carb:\nVery nice aroma\nTastes alcoholic \nNo off flavours yet\n\nAfter carb:\nLooks and tastes amazing!",
